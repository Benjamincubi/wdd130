            Buenos Aires, often dubbed the "Paris of South America," is the vibrant and cosmopolitan capital of Argentina, situated on the western bank of the Río de la Plata. It is renowned for its preserved eclectic European architecture, which reflects the massive influx of European immigrants—particularly from Italy and Spain—who shaped the city into a cultural melting pot. Home to a bustling metropolitan area of over 16 million people, the city is a national hub for commerce, technology, and culture. Buenos Aires is the birthplace of the passionate and intricate tango, and its distinct neighborhoods, such as La Boca with its colorful facades and Recoleta with its French-style grandeur, offer an unparalleled urban experience marked by lively cafés, world-class steakhouses (parrillas), and an intense love for football.
